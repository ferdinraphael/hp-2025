# Scene 4 – The Watchful Cat

## The Long Day

As everyone on Privet Drive was drifting off to sleep, there was a certain someone who showed no signs of sleepiness. The tabby cat on the garden wall of Number Four was as awake as a cat could be. She had been here since early morning, arriving before the neighborhood stirred. As people stepped out, they had all stared. _Quite rudely_, she thought. _You'd think they had never seen a cat in their lives._

The cat had taken an interest in Number Four and spent most of the day there. She had observed the Dursleys with much curiosity. But that curiosity soon turned into pity. She had never met anyone as thick-headed as them — and the way they treated their child, indulging his every demand...

The cat highly disapproved of this parenting approach. In her view, this wasn't parenting at all. It was most unfortunate for that boy to have been born here.

The cat had every intention of leaving and never coming back. But she hadn't come here for them. She was expecting someone — someone who had chosen to come here of all places and at a time like this. Odd as it may be, only he could confirm the rumours she'd been hearing. She had questions — far too many. Only he could give definitive answers.

As the night deepened, she stood perfectly still, her eyes on the far corner of the street. Time passed. Nothing moved — not until just around three in the morning.

## Midnight Arrival

That's when he appeared.

One moment, the street was empty. The next, an old man stood beneath the streetlight, as if he had quietly stepped out of thin air. He was tall and thin, his long silver hair and beard shimmering in the orange glow. He wore a deep purple cloak and high-heeled silver-buckled boots.

The cat watched him closely. She could recognise those bright blue eyes anywhere — eyes that glinted behind his half-moon glasses.

This was the man she had been waiting for.  
The one she deeply respected.  
**Albus Dumbledore.**

She continued watching him. He was searching for something in his cloak. He paused and looked directly at the cat, as if he could tell she was watching him. A smile came across his face.

Soon he took out a silver cigarette lighter. Flicking it open, he held it up and clicked it.  
The light from the lamp nearest to him went off. He clicked again and the same happened to the next lamp. He repeated this till all the lights went off.

When the lamp nearest to the cat had gone off, she noticed the light actually _zoom_ away towards Dumbledore.  
_A neat trick,_ thought the cat. _Even after all these years, he can still surprise me._

Soon the entire street was in complete darkness. A moment later, she could make out Dumbledore walking towards her. He came to the driveway of Number Four and sat down next to the cat on the garden wall.

## Rumours and Truths

"Didn't expect to see you here, Professor McGonagall," he said without making eye contact.

The cat sighed and, with grace and elegance, transformed into a middle-aged woman wearing an emerald cloak and a pointy hat. She wore square glasses that perfectly matched the markings the cat had around her eyes.

"How did you know it was me?" she asked.

"I've seen so many cats, but none as still as you. Why are you here when you could have been celebrating? Everyone is celebrating."

Professor McGonagall’s voice sharpened. "Yes. I've seen enough of it. It was all over their news — the Muggles know something is going on. Flocks of owls... shooting stars... going out in non-Muggle clothing... The Muggles aren't stupid. We wizards should have some sense. Should have been more careful."

To her irritation, Dumbledore replied, "Can't really blame them, can we? There has hardly been any cause to celebrate for eleven years."

"Of course! But what about the Statute of Secrecy?", she asked strongly. She personally knew how important the statute was.

"I doubt the Ministry is going to punish every wizard in the UK."
Dumbledore was smiling again as if to some internal joke. But Professor McGonagall was not satisfied.

"Even then — we can’t just stroll into Muggle areas dressed like this, swapping rumours. Imagine, on the same day that _You-Know-Who_ disappears, the Muggles find out all about us!"

"My dear Professor, surely someone as sensible as you can call him by his name. For eleven years, I’ve tried to convince everyone to use it — Voldemort."

She flinched but recovered. "Of course you haven’t. But you’re different."
Professor McGonagall was unable to hide her admiration.
"Everyone knows you’re the only one _You-Know-Who_ —", she saw his eyebrow go up, "— fine, _Voldemort_ — was truly afraid of."

Dumbledore’s reply was calm. "To be honest, Voldemort had powers I will never have."

"That’s because you are too noble to use them."

Dumbledore chuckled. "You think too highly of me."

She drew a deep breath. This conversation was going further away from the questions she needed to ask. She decided to come directly to the point and looking at Dumbledore, asked, "He’s really gone, isn’t he?"

"It certainly seems so."

Relief washed over her. She was quite grateful for the war to end. She had suffered losses and couldn't afford to lose any more. But then she remembered another rumour — something that had been worrying her a lot. She asked in a low voice, "Have you heard what people are saying? About how he was stopped?"

This was the reason she had been waiting for him all day. She had heard the rumours but couldn't believe them. She wouldn't believe them. Not until she heard it from Dumbledore. Her eyes were focused on him waiting for his reply.

However, instead of answering, Dumbledore reached into his cloak. "Would you like a sherbet lemon?"

Professor McGonagall was puzzled. Not because of her lack of knowledge — she grew up around Muggles and knew all about Muggle sweets — but by the fact that he had totally ignored the conversation. "No thank you," she said briskly. This was _not_ the time for sweets. She needed answers.
She tried again, "The rumours say last night Voldemort turned up in Godric’s Hollow. They say he went to find the Potters. They say that... That Lily and James are... that they’re... dead."

He bowed his head, confirming her fears. She was quite shocked. "But Lily and James... It can't be... It mustn't be", she whispered feebly.
Despite all their precautions, it had still happened. Lily and James — gone. They were one of the best students she had had. Her personal favourites. Gone. Just like that. Their deaths cast a shadow over their victory over Voldemort.

Dumbledore, probably sensing her state of mind, patted her gently on the shoulder. She could hear the weight in his breath. It was obvious that this death affected him more than he was letting on.

## The Boy’s Fate

But she had more questions. So she went on, with her voice trembling in grief, "There is more. Some rumours say he tried to kill their son, Harry, as well. But... but he couldn't... he couldn't kill that boy — no one knows why. But they also say at that moment, somehow Voldemort's power broke — and this is the reason he's gone."

Dumbledore nodded.

"So it's all true?", Professor McGonagall was quite astounded. "After all the people he’s killed... he couldn’t kill a little boy? But how on earth did Harry survive?"

"We can guess," Dumbledore said. "But we may never know for sure."

Professor Minerva McGonagall wasn't new to the concept of grief. But she had learnt restraint. Yet she found her eyes were moist. She wiped them with a handkerchief and thought that this situation still had a small bright side — Lily and James' son had survived the skirmish. She also heard a sniff from Dumbledore and was sure he was also deeply affected, however casual he might seem.

She noticed Dumbledore pull out a golden watch — certainly _not_ of any muggle design. It had twelve hands each pointing in a different direction. Along the edge, she saw what looked like tiny planets orbiting — but not all at the same speed or direction. This was probably something of his own design. He soon put it back in saying, "Hagrid seems to be running late. I'm guessing he was the one who told you that I'd be here."

_Perceptive as ever_, Minerva thought. "Yes. But why here of all places?"

"I’ve come to unite Harry with the only family he has left."

Minerva was shocked and jumped to her feet. In a slightly raised voice she cried, "You mean the people who live behind that door? No, Dumbledore. You can’t do this. I’ve been watching them all day. They’re nothing like us. Probably the worst kind of Muggles. They have a son of their own — I saw the way he put up a tantrum and kicked his mom and how she quickly gave whatever he wanted to appease him. This is no place for Harry. Please don't do this, Albus", she pleaded."

Dumbledore replied firmly, "It’s the best place for him. His uncle and aunt will be able to explain everything to him when he can understand it. I've written them a letter."

Minerva was starting to feel a bit faint. _Dumbledore didn't understand_.
"Do you really think a _letter_ can explain all that’s happened? They can never understand him! Harry is already famous. Every wizard and witch will know his name. There would be books written about what happened last night. He would be a celebrity."

"Exactly my point." She looked up at him puzzled. He was looking quite seriously at her.
"Can't you see Minerva? Famous for something he can’t even remember. Famous even before he can understand what the word famous means. Think what that will do to him. It's better for him here, where he won’t know until he’s old enough to understand. Too much power and fame — especially too early — is never a good thing, Minerva"

She could see the earnestness in his eyes. She thought back on how Dumbledore had always avoided power and authority even when offered to him repeatedly. She realized he had given this enough thought before reaching this conclusion.

She said humbly, "Of course. You are right as always. But where is he now?"
She wondered if Dumbledore might be hiding him inside his cloak.

"He is with Hagrid who must be reaching us soon."

Minerva was surprised. Such an important task to someone like him. She asked, "Do you really think it's safe to trust Hagrid with this?"

"I would trust Hagrid with my life," said Dumbledore.

"Of course, his heart is in the right place," said Minerva slightly annoyed, "but even you know how careless he usually is."
She had never quite understood Dumbledore's faith in people who, in her eyes, weren't ready for it.

## The Giant and the Bike

Before Dumbledore could reply, a low rumble began — growing steadily louder. She glanced around the street — nothing. But the sound rose like a roar, now clearly coming from above. She looked up just in time to catch sight of a massive motorcycle falling from the sky. It landed on the road in front of them.

She quickly glanced around to see if anyone might have been woken up by the sound. But all the muggle lights were still off and they were probably still in their beds. She wondered if she should have put a charm to drown out any noise. But she hadn't expected this to happen. At any rate, the sound had quieted down after the fall.

The motorcycle stood gleaming under the moonlight. Its vintage chrome frame caught the silver glow, and runes shimmered softly along its sides. The rider — whom Minerva immediately recognized — was enormous: at least twice the height of an average man, and three times as wide. A mane of shaggy black hair tumbled past his shoulders, blending into a beard that nearly swallowed his face. His black eyes glistened with grief. Minerva had no doubt — he'd been crying all the way. In his hands, he held a deep blue blanket.

"Hagrid, finally," Dumbledore said. "Hope there were no problems."
Minerva could sense both relief and concern in his voice. She wondered what danger he might have been anticipating.

"Nah, sir — the house was nearly flattened, but I got ’im out ’fore the Muggles showed up with their phones out. He nodded off as we flew past Bristol — poor thing was fast asleep."

Minerva and Dumbledore looked into the blanket and saw the baby boy asleep. She noticed faint markings along the edge of the blanket — probably protection runes to keep the baby safe. Dumbledore had clearly thought of every aspect.
On the boy's forehead, beneath his messy black hair, was a peculiar lightning shaped cut.

"Is that where—?" Minerva began.

Dumbledore, anticipating the question, nodded. "Yes. That scar is permanent."

"Can’t you do something?", she asked worried.

"Unfortunately no. But even if I could, I’d rather not. Scars can come in handy."

Then turning to Hagrid, he asked, "Where did you get that motorcycle?"

    "Young Sirius Black lent it to me, Professor Dumbledore, sir — barely got the chance to thank 'im."

## Goodbyes in the Dark

Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and walked towards the Dursley house.

Hagrid suddenly began to cry loudly.

"Shhh! Be quiet! You'll wake the muggles!", Minerva warned. This kind of carelessness was exactly what she worried about with Hagrid.

"I... I just can't take it — Lily an' James, dead... poor little Harry... livin' with Muggles..."

Minerva could only catch part of his words between sobs. "Yes, yes, I know it's terrible", she said in a low voice, trying to calm him, "But you need to control yourself, Hagrid, or we'll be exposed"

Meanwhile, Dumbledore had gently laid Harry on the doorstep. He pulled a neatly folded letter from his cloak, tucked it inside the blanket, and returned to the others.

For a minute, the three of them stood in silence, staring at the boy — interrupted only by Hagrid's sniffs.

Finally Dumbledore said quietly, "Well... that's about it. We shouldn't stay here. Best we go join the celebrations."

"Yeah, I'll be gettin' Sirius his bike back. Night, Professor McGonagall — Professor Dumbledore, sir", said Hagrid, his voice thick. He climbed onto the motorcycle, kicked the engine to life, and roared away, rising into the night until he vanished out of sight.

"Hope to see you soon, Professor McGonagall", Dumbledore said. Minerva nodded, still holding back her emotions.

She watched as he walked down the street, took out his silver cigarette lighter and clicked it. Balls of light emerged and hovered briefly before streaking back to their lamps, bathing the streets in a soft orange glow once more. Then, without a sound, Dumbledore vanished into thin air.

Alone now, she turned back into the tabby cat and climbed up to the doorstep to take one last look at her boy. She wanted so much to stay and make sure that he was alright. But she personally knew the risks. For a few moments, she watched him — sleeping warm and snug despite the cold outside. She knew the blanket would keep him safe. He rolled over in his sleep, unaware of the world he'd been separated from — a world where many were likely raising their glasses and toasting, _To Harry Potter — the boy who lived_.

Wishing him all the best, the cat slipped away down the opposite end of the street, leaving Harry alone on the doorstep. He slept peacefully, soon to be discovered by a completely bewildered Dursley family — a family whose lives, from this day forward, would be anything but normal.
