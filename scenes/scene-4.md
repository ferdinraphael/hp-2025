# Scene 4 â€“ The Watchful Cat

## The Long Day

As everyone on Privet Drive was drifting off to sleep, there was a certain someone who showed no signs of sleepiness. The tabby cat on the garden wall of Number Four was as awake as a cat could be. She had been here since early morning, arriving before the neighborhood stirred. As people stepped out, they had all stared. _Quite rudely_, she thought. _You'd think they had never seen a cat in their lives._

The cat had taken an interest in Number Four and spent most of the day there. She had observed the Dursleys with much curiosity. But that curiosity soon turned into pity. She had never met anyone as thick-headed as them â€” and the way they treated their child, indulging his every demand...

The cat highly disapproved of this parenting approach. In her view, this wasn't parenting at all. It was most unfortunate for that boy to have been born here.

The cat had every intention of leaving and never coming back. But she hadn't come here for them. She was expecting someone â€” someone who had chosen to come here of all places and at a time like this. Odd as it may be, only he could confirm the rumours she'd been hearing. She had questions â€” far too many. Only he could give definitive answers.

As the night deepened, she stood perfectly still, her eyes on the far corner of the street. Time passed. Nothing moved â€” not until just around midnight.

## Midnight Arrival

That's when he appeared.

One moment, the street was empty. The next, an old man stood beneath the streetlight, as if he had quietly stepped out of thin air. He was tall and thin, his long silver hair and beard shimmering in the orange glow. He wore a deep purple cloak and high-heeled silver-buckled boots.

The cat watched him closely. She could recognise those bright blue eyes anywhere â€” eyes that glinted behind his half-moon glasses.

This was the man she had been waiting for.  
The one she deeply respected.  
**Albus Dumbledore.**

She continued watching him. He was searching for something in his cloak. He paused and looked directly at the cat, as if he could tell she was watching him. A smile came across his face.

Soon he took out a silver cigarette lighter. Flicking it open, he held it up and clicked it.  
The light from the lamp nearest to him went off. He clicked again and the same happened to the next lamp. He repeated this till all the lights went off.

When the lamp nearest to the cat had gone off, she noticed the light actually _zoom_ away towards Dumbledore.  
_A neat trick,_ thought the cat. _Even after all these years, he can still surprise me._

Soon the entire street was in complete darkness. A moment later, she could make out Dumbledore walking towards her. He came to the driveway of Number Four and sat down next to the cat on the garden wall.

## Rumours and Truths

"Didn't expect to see you here, Professor McGonagall," he said without making eye contact.

The cat sighed and, with grace and elegance, transformed into a middle-aged woman wearing an emerald cloak and a pointy hat. She wore square glasses that perfectly matched the markings the cat had around her eyes.

"How did you know it was me?" she asked.

"I've seen so many cats, but none as still as you. Why are you here when you could have been celebrating? Everyone is celebrating."

Professor McGonagallâ€™s voice sharpened. "Yes. I've seen enough of it. It was all over their news â€” the Muggles know something is going on. Flocks of owls... shooting stars... going out in non-Muggle clothing... The Muggles aren't stupid. We wizards should have some sense. Should have been more careful."

"Can't really blame them, can we? There has hardly been any cause to celebrate for eleven years."

"Of course! But what about the Statute of Secrecy?"

"I doubt the Ministry is going to punish every wizard in the UK."

"Even then â€” we canâ€™t just stroll into Muggle areas dressed like this, swapping rumours. Imagine, on the same day that You-Know-Who disappears, the Muggles find out all about us!"

"My dear Professor, surely someone as sensible as you can call him by his name. For eleven years, Iâ€™ve tried to convince everyone to use it â€” Voldemort."

She flinched but recovered. "Of course you havenâ€™t. But youâ€™re different. Everyone knows youâ€™re the only one heâ€” fine, _Voldemort_ â€” was truly afraid of."

Dumbledoreâ€™s reply was calm. "To be honest, Voldemort had powers I will never have."

"Thatâ€™s because you are too noble to use them."

Dumbledore chuckled. "You think too highly of me."

She drew a deep breath and finally asked, "Heâ€™s really gone, isnâ€™t he?"

"It certainly seems so."

Relief washed over her â€” until another rumour rose to the surface. "Have you heard what people are saying? About how he was stopped?"

Instead of answering, Dumbledore pulled a small packet from his cloak. "Would you like a sherbet lemon?"

"No thank you," she said briskly. This was _not_ the time for sweets. "The rumours say Voldemort went to Godricâ€™s Hollow. That Lily and James are... that theyâ€™re dead."

He bowed his head in confirmation. The words hit her like a blow. Lily and James â€” gone. Her personal favourites. Gone in a single night.

## The Boyâ€™s Fate

"And their son?" she asked softly.

"Alive. Voldemort tried to kill him, but failed. That was when his power broke."

"After all the people heâ€™s killed... he couldnâ€™t kill a little boy?" She shook her head. "How did Harry survive?"

"We can guess," Dumbledore said. "But we may never know for sure."

She wiped her eyes with a handkerchief, finding comfort only in the fact that Harry lived.

Then she saw him check a curious golden watch with twelve hands and orbiting planets. "Hagridâ€™s late," he said. "Iâ€™m guessing he told you Iâ€™d be here."

"Yes. But why here of all places?"

"Iâ€™ve come to unite Harry with the only family he has left."

Her head snapped up. "You mean these people? No, Dumbledore. You canâ€™t do this. Theyâ€™re nothing like us. Iâ€™ve been watching them all day."

"Itâ€™s the best place for him."

"Do you really think a _letter_ can explain all thatâ€™s happened? Heâ€™ll be famous â€” thereâ€™ll be books about him."

"Exactly my point. Famous for something he canâ€™t remember. Think what that will do to him. Better for him here, where he wonâ€™t know until heâ€™s ready."

She understood then â€” this was Dumbledoreâ€™s way. Avoiding power, even when it was offered.

## The Giant and the Bike

A low rumble cut through the night. It grew into a roar from above. A massive motorcycle descended and landed before them.

The moonlight revealed its vintage chrome frame and softly glowing runes. The rider was enormous: twice the height of an average man, three times as wide, with a mane of shaggy black hair blending into a beard. His black eyes glistened with grief. In his arms, a bundle of blankets.

"Hagrid, finally," Dumbledore said. "Hope there were no problems."

"Nah, sir â€” the house was nearly flattened, but I got â€™im out â€™fore the Muggles showed up with their phones out. He nodded off as we flew past Bristol."

They looked into the blankets. Beneath the boyâ€™s messy black hair was a peculiar lightning-shaped cut.

"Is that whereâ€”?" Minerva began.

"Yes. That scar is permanent."

"Canâ€™t you do something?"

"Even if I could, Iâ€™d rather not. Scars can come in handy."

"Where did you get that motorcycle?"

"Young Sirius Black lent it to me, Professor Dumbledore, sir."

## Goodbyes in the Dark

Dumbledore took Harry to the doorstep, tucked a letter into his blanket, and stepped back. They stood in silence for a moment.

"Well... thatâ€™s about it," Dumbledore said. "We shouldnâ€™t stay here."

"Yeah, Iâ€™ll be gettinâ€™ Sirius his bike back. Night, Professor McGonagall â€” Professor Dumbledore, sir." Hagrid roared away into the night.

"Hope to see you soon, Professor McGonagall," Dumbledore said. Then he restored the streetlights with a click of his lighter and vanished without a sound.

Alone now, she turned back into the tabby cat and leapt onto the garden wall. One last look at the boy â€” asleep, unaware of the world heâ€™d been separated from, a world raising its glasses to _Harry Potter â€” the boy who lived_.

Wishing him all the best, the cat slipped away, leaving him to be found by a completely bewildered Dursley family â€” whose lives, from this day forward, would be anything but normal.
