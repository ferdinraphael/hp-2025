# Scene 2: Vernon's Day Out

## Sunday Traffic

There wasn't much traffic today on account of it being a Sunday. But traffic slowed down near the edge of the town. He flipped on the radio, half-listening. Something about a plane crash... or maybe another flashy tech gadget launch? He didn't care â€“ nothing useful ever came out of these news reports.

A few minutes later he saw the cause of the slow traffic â€“ a large group of strangely dressed people going about the road as if it was a park. Vernon hated people dressed in funny clothes. Probably leftovers from some Halloween party â€“ young drunks, no doubt. They seemed to be quite excited about something that Vernon didn't care about. He just wished they would clear the road and go some place else.

As he crossed them, he noticed that some of them were older than he was â€“ and one was even wearing an emerald green cloak! Vernon's fingers drummed furiously on the steering wheel. He was getting quite impatient now. Young men wearing funny costumes was one thing â€“ but older men too! Some men just never grow up.

A few minutes later, he crossed the group and with that shut them out of his mind, focusing on his shopping again.

## Averley and Co.

Soon he arrived in the parking lot of Averley and Co's, a large chain store of home furnishings and appliances. The storefront was lined with neat signs and dull colors â€“ just the way he liked it. Everything inside was perfectly ordered and labeled. He felt at peace among the price tags and polished floor tiles.

The windows on the store were curtained to create a warm cozy feel. It was a good thing for Vernon â€“ or he would have lost his peace quite soon. Just outside, owls were swooping through the air in broad daylight. People in the streets were pausing, pointing, even taking selfies with owls flapping in the background to post on Facebook and Instagram. Vernon, of course, wasn't on social media â€“ and was blissfully unaware.

He had, in fact, had quite a normal morning. He yelled at the sales rep for offering only a 30% off â€“ though in his company, he'd never allow anything more than 20%. He scoffed at another employee who tried to showcase a smart fridge. Fridges shouldn't talk.

It was nearly lunchtime and he hadn't bought a thing â€“ but he was having a good time. He decided to stop by the store's cafeteria to grab a bite.

## Cafeteria Surprise

As he entered the cafeteria, he once again saw a group of people in cloaks. He had forgotten all about them. Their presence somehow made him uneasy. This group was also quite excited but he did not smell any alcohol when he crossed them. Halloween was yesterday, and it was already midday. Why were they still dressed like that?

He ordered sausage, chips and baked beans â€“ the most normal food on the menu. He wasn't interested in trying something new when what he already had was perfectly normal. He took his tray to the only available table. Probably should've come a bit earlier to beat the lunch rush, thought Vernon.

As Vernon was eating his lunch, he realized that the group in cloak was not far away and he could hear some words of their conversation. But none of it made much sense. He had no idea what a "portkey" was and had never heard of butter-flavored beer. Kids these days just make up words.

Moments later, another group of customers entered and the earlier cloaked group made way for them â€“ ending up closer to Vernon's table. Vernon could hear them better now. They were saying, "I heard about the Potters. And their son Harry."

Vernon froze. He gripped his fork tighter without realizing it. He couldn't believe he had just heard that cursed name. He suddenly lost all appetite and left his food to leave the cafe. He took his mobile and was just about to call Petunia before he changed his mind. He thought a bit about everything. Maybe he was being stupid. Potter wasn't a unique name. There had to be other Potters with sons named Harry. He wasn't even sure if the boy's name was Harry. There was no point upsetting Petunia without being sure. But he definitely didn't feel like staying here any longer and decided to head back home.

## The Parking Lot

As he walked to the parking lot lost in thought, he accidentally knocked over a tiny old man in a violet cloak.

"Sorry," Vernon muttered automatically â€“ then realized who he had bumped into. Another one of them.

To his surprise, the man smiled widely and spoke in a small, high-pitched voice, "Ah, don't mind me! Nothing could upset me today! You-Know-Who is finally gone! Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating!"

And just like that the old man gave Vernon a hug and walked away.

Vernon stood frozen, part furious, part confused. He had just been hugged by a total stranger in public. He checked his pockets. Everything was still there.

He had also been called a Muggle. He didn't know what it meant, but he was sure he ought to be offended.

In a rare moment, Vernon hoped â€“ for the second time that day â€“ that he was imagining things. He got into his car, heart thudding a bit faster now, and drove home.

## A Troubling Sight

As he entered his driveway, something on his garden wall caught his eye â€“ a tabby cat. The same one from morning. Had the same markings around its eyes.

He tried to shoo it away, but it remained still. And instead gave him a firm, almost judgemental look. That was not how cats were supposed to behave.

Despite the day he had, he composed himself as he walked up to the door â€“ determined not to worry his wife with any of this.
