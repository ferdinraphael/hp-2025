# Scene 1: Petuniaâ€™s Morning

## Petuniaâ€™s Perfect Boy

It had been eleven years since the day Dudley had come into Petunia's life. She still remembered the fierce pride she'd felt, holding that little boy in her arms for the first time. Dudley was no longer little, but had grown larger and rounder, just like his father.

On this perfectly dull morning, she let her eyes wander over the photographs she had so carefully arranged on the wall. There was Dudley on his first bicycle, blonde hair waving in the wind â€” his sixth birthday. He'd been quite happy until his first fall, after which the bike had been abandoned for years â€” until just a few days ago, when he declared he wanted a racing model. Petunia had known he would start riding again in his own time. She had been right.

The wall told Dudley's story: enjoying the carousel at the fair on his seventh birthday, unwrapping his brand new iPad on a Christmas morning, playing at a gaming console on his 9th birthday, a selfie taken by him along with Vernon and Petunia during the COVID year â€” the worst birthday Dudley had ever had to endure.  
Her smile faded. The worst â€” and yet not the only birthday with trouble. Every year, something had gone wrong. And she knew exactly whose fault that was â€” a boy called Harry Potter.

## Strange Occurrences

Nearly ten years ago, on that dreadful morning, she had opened her front door to find him there â€” barely a year old, with an ugly, unnatural cut on his forehead â€” and nothing but a letter tucked in his blanket. Its contents had made her nearly faint. That was a day she refused to think about.  
But avoiding the memory wasn't easy with Harry under the roof. Out of the greatness of her heart, she had agreed to keep him â€” no one else would have, not without kicking up a fuss. The decision had clearly shocked Vernon, though he'd had the sense never to question her about it.

Today, she would see to it that Harry did not ruin Dudley's special day. She had already arranged with Mrs Figg to look after the boy the whole day. So she only had to get through breakfast with him. Mrs Figg had been a blessing in recent years, whenever she needed someone to babysit Harry. She never complained â€” never looked twice when something unusual happened around him. Petunia couldn't have asked for better â€” because strange things always did happen around Harry.

His hair was always so messy and untidy, despite the money wasted on the numerous barber trips. She'd had to do it herself with her own kitchen scissors. She had cut it quite short so he would not need constant pointless barber visits. And she had taken special care to leave out the bangs so it could hide his nasty scar. She'd been quite satisfied with her work â€” but the next morning, that ungrateful boy's hair was exactly as before. So it hadn't been the barber at all â€” It had been him. Always him.  
Another time, there'd been an angry letter from the headmistress â€” Harry caught standing on the roof of the school kitchen. And yet he had the nerve to claim that he'd just tried to jump over the trashcan. After that, the school staff had looked at them as though it were their fault. The humiliation of it still burned.

The boy was just like his mother, pulling pranks, being as abnormal as she always had been. But she would not allow it. Not this time. He just needed a bit of disciplining. It was her responsibility. Living in the cupboard under the stairs was a start. Locking him in there at least knocked some sense into him for a while.

## Morning Bustle

By the time the others stirred, she had already arranged all the presents and started on breakfast. She realized it was already eight o'clock. They had the day planned at a zoo and she needed to make sure everyone was out by ten.  
She marched to the cupboard under the stairs and rapped on the door, calling out "Harrryy... Up! Get up! Now!" She walked back to the kitchen and put out a pan and started cooking some bacon.  
A minute later, she went back, "Are you up yet? You need to go look after the bacon right away. And don't forget to wash your hands thoroughly before you touch anything. I need everything to be perfect for Dudley's birthday."

She then went upstairs to wake the others. Vernon was almost ready but little Dudley was still fast asleep. He looked perfect, just like a baby angel. She woke him up and said, "Happy birthday my little Diddy! We have an exciting day planned for today. Why don't you freshen up and come downstairs?" The word birthday seemed to immediately wake him up. He quickly went to the restroom to freshen up. Of course he was quite excited.

Petunia went down again to check on the food. She saw Harry standing at the stove turning the bacon. He was thinner than other normal children â€” all those ridiculous antics had drained the life out of him. "Once the bacon is done, put on some eggs â€” and don't overcook it like last time!"  
She found Vernon already at the table, piled high with Dudley's presents, reading his newspaper. She went to her desk and found her iPad in the drawer next to the willow box. It looked as spotless as the day she'd shoved it in, though she hadn't touched it since. She ignored it, snatched up her iPad, and hurried back downstairs to capture Dudley's reaction.  
As Dudley came down the stairs, his eyes glued to his smartphone while scrolling through social media posts, he did not notice anything until Petunia called out to him. She could see his eyes widen as he rushed to the presents on the table â€” gaming laptop, VR headset, racing bike and plenty more. He had started counting his gifts when Harry put the plates of bacon and eggs on the table.  
Still capturing the scene, she saw Dudley's joy fade away. "Only thirty-six? That's two less than last year!"  
She quickly replied, "Darling, you haven't yet counted Aunt Marge's present. It's under this big one from mommy and daddy."  
This didn't seem to satisfy him. "Thirty-seven then." His face was turning red. Petunia could sense what was going to happen next and quickly added, "And we'll buy two more when we go out today, darling. Is that okay?"  
"So that's thirty... thirty..."  
"Thirty-nine, darling. See? Even more than last year."  
"Oh. I guess it's okay then," he sat down opening some of the presents.  
Uncle Vernon laughed, "He is just like me. Knows how much he really is worth."  
She heaved a sigh of relief. How could she have forgotten to check the count? Anyway, she had managed to save his day.

## A Hiccup in the Plan

Just then her phone rang. It was Mrs Figg. She had said that she'd broken her leg that morning. And so she couldn't take Harry. Petunia was quite upset and worried. She was dizzy for a moment. She looked at Dudley who was unwrapping his Apple Watch. Vernon seemed to realize something was wrong.  
She said aloud, "We have a problem, Vernon. Mrs Figg broke her leg and can't take him."  
She immediately saw Vernon's brow furrow and Dudley's eyes widen in shock. Vernon started looking for alternate suggestions.  
"What if we call Marge?" Vernon asked.  
"Absolutely not. She hates the kid." And she'd never have heard the end of it.  
"What about your friend, Yvonne?"  
"On vacation in Majorca," snapped Petunia. They were out of options. Mrs Figg had always been reliable, they'd never needed an alternative before.  
She heard Harry's voice, "You could just leave me here."  
Petunia replied, " No way in hell! The house will be wrecked by the time I got back."  
She barely noticed Harry's reply. Her mind was coming to a horrible realization. She slowly said, "Maybe we can take him to the zoo."  
Dudley began to cry loudly. Petunia ran to him and hugged him, saying, "Don't cry! Don't worry, Mamma won't let him ruin your day."  
The doorbell rang. And a moment later, Dudley's best friend, Piers Polkiss, walked in with his mother. Dudley stopped crying at once. Petunia gave a sigh of relief â€” at least she'd managed to comfort him before it escalated.  
Half an hour later, with no other option left, Harry was wedged beside Dudley and Piers in the back seat of the car. Petunia would not let this ruin Dudley's day. She would keep Harry in sight at all times â€” and there would be no mischief.
