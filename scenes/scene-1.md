# Scene 1: The Dursleys

## Number Four, Privet Drive

The Dursleys took great satisfaction in the fact that nothing remotely out of the ordinary had come to number four, Privet Drive — and they intended to keep it that way.  
Vernon Dursley liked routine. He liked predictability. And he definitely did not like being surprised. Surprises, he believed, were the breeding ground of chaos.

The Dursleys had a perfect life, nothing to be ashamed of. Nothing except a very bothersome secret. They tried their best to bury it — to pretend it had never existed at all. No one could find out about the Potters.

Lily Potter was Petunia Dursley's sister, but they hadn't spoken in many years. Mrs Dursley did everything she could to erase her sister — and her useless husband — from her life.  
They knew the Potters had a son, about the same age as their son Dudley. And they definitely could not let that boy have any influence over their precious son.

## A Very Normal Morning

It was the first of November, a Sunday. When Vernon woke up, the sky outside was dull and grey. It was the perfect kind of weather for the Dursleys — one with no surprises.  
Despite being a day off, Vernon had spotted a flyer about a weekend sale for furniture, appliances, rugs, etc. and he wasn't about to miss it. He had recently been promoted to Director of Sales and in his view, his house should reflect it.

Petunia, who spent more time online than she'd admit, had said, "Why waste a Sunday driving around? We could buy everything online."  
But Vernon had insisted on going there in person. He didn't trust online reviews, didn't believe in digital discounts, didn't like strange men coming to his house for delivery.  
In fact, he had even convinced his company to stay out of _that online sale rubbish_.

As Vernon was getting ready, in the kitchen, Petunia was chatting idly on her mobile, while also getting breakfast ready for her son.  
Her blonde hair, perfectly ironed, was clipped back, and her dressing gown looked freshly pressed.  
Dudley, just over a year old, sat in a high chair banging a plastic spoon on the tray with alarming authority.

None of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past the window.

## A Curious Sight

After breakfast, Mr Dursley pecked Mrs Dursley on the cheek and tried to kiss Dudley goodbye — but missed, as Dudley was in full tantrum mode, throwing his cereal at the walls because his favorite show, _Peppa Pig_, wasn’t playing.  
As Mr Dursley left the house, he chortled, “Little tyke,” as though this sort of behavior was completely normal. He got into his car and backed out of number four’s drive.

Something strange caught Vernon’s eye — a cat reading a map.  
It took a moment for this to sink in. When he turned to look again, there was a tabby cat, sitting on the corner of the street, staring back at him. There was no map.

Vernon let out a small sigh of relief. He must have imagined it.  
He frowned — he wasn’t a fan of imagination. He believed it was a complete waste of time: not normal, not useful.

As he drove around the corner, he couldn’t resist another glance at the cat.  
The cat was now reading the sign that said _Privet Drive_.  
No, he told himself — _looking_ at it, not _reading_ it. Cats can’t read maps or signs — this was probably the most absurd thing that had ever crossed his mind.

As he drove out of town, he decided not to think about it again.  
He had more important things to think about — like recliners, discount microwaves, and the possibility of a good deal on a new rug.
