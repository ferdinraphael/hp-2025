# Scene 3: Petunia's Sunday

## Neighborhood Matters

While Vernon's day had been anything but ordinary, Petunia's day had her own share of the unusual. As usual, she had woken up quite early. Even on Sundays, she couldn't sleep in — keeping the Dursley house in order was her self-appointed duty. She was dressed and downstairs before Vernon woke up.

She had just begun breakfast when her mobile buzzed. It was Mrs. Bletchley — head of the neighborhood watch and a proud guardian of Privet Drive's appearance. Mrs. Bletchley was as obsessed with maintaining order as Petunia was, and the two of them got along splendidly.

Mrs. Bletchley was talking about how one of their neighbours had an overgrown lawn — a black spot, in her view, on the lane's image. She felt such matters could not be overlooked and must be dealt with swiftly.

Petunia took a moment to answer. With the phone on speaker and breakfast on the stove, she was wrestling Dudley, now awake, into his high chair. After success, she expressed her agreement. She rarely disagreed; Mrs. Bletchley's ideas were usually quite good. And Petunia believed rules and order were the best defense against anything out of the ordinary.

There was a time when Petunia had felt differently. But that was a long time ago. She had married Vernon as he was the most ordinary man she had seen. And together, the Dursleys had settled here, in the most uneventful place they could find.

Mrs. Bletchley continued chatting about various important topics — the appropriate colors for house paint, a neighbor's new car, a stray cat roaming the neighborhood today, and other such matters. By the time they hung up, Vernon was already halfway through his breakfast, and Dudley was beginning to have a tantrum — his favorite show, Peppa Pig, had just ended.

Once Vernon left for shopping, Petunia was left struggling with Dudley on her own. She preferred ordering online — quicker, quieter, cheaper — but Vernon had not yet embraced the digital world and believed phones were for talking — and nothing else.

Petunia, meanwhile, had already posted three pictures of Dudley that morning, and liked to keep an eye on the neighbours' updates. She knew who got a new car, whose dog was sick, and who was secretly growing tomatoes in their front yard — all without stepping outside.

## Tantrums and Tactics

By noon, she had already cleaned the house, prepared lunch, finished all her chores and was now trying to get Dudley to have a bath.  
Dudley was always quite a handful. Petunia believed it was because he wasn't getting enough attention — so she made it a point to give him extra.  
It was exhausting but in her mind, that's what it took to keep things normal at home.

After bath, Dudley began demanding sweets. Petunia calmly explained that they were all out — but he began screaming and thrashing about, kicking up another tantrum.  
This was getting out of hand. She had to act fast. She grabbed her phone, reassuring Dudley in her sweetest voice that she was going to get him some right away.

As she unlocked her phone, her eyes landed on a Facebook post — an image of several cloaked men and women gathered in the streets.  
The caption read, "Halloween extended?"  
She froze.  
Memories she had long buried surged to the surface — uninvited, unwelcome.  
Could it really be....?

She read the caption again.  
_Halloween extended._  
Surely it was just a group of over-enthusiastic youngsters, still in costumes the day after.  
Yes — that must be it.

A sudden kick from an impatient Dudley snapped her back to the present.  
She pushed those thoughts out of her mind, switched to Just Eat, and ordered his favorite dessert from a local shop.  
Delivery: 30–60 minutes.  
In the meanwhile, she plopped him in front of the TV. That would keep him busy.

An hour later, everything was settled. Dudley was happily eating his favorite dessert while watching TV, and Petunia finally had a moment to herself. She walked over to her desk to fetch her tablet — it was time to curate some Dudley posts before lunch. Neighbourhood appearances had to be maintained.

Next to the tablet sat a pale wooden box — made of willow, soft and smooth to the touch.  
Her hand lingered over it for a moment. The lock was still firm.  
Distant memories threatened to resurface. But she pushed them down.

Instead, she picked up her tablet and doubled down on perfecting Dudley's next post.  
It had to be the best one yet.

After lunch, Petunia kept herself busy — changing the sheets, switching out the curtains, tidying up the sofa. Her usual Sunday routine.

As she adjusted the fresh curtains, she spotted a tabby cat sitting in her driveway — with unusual markings around its eyes.

This must be the stray cat Mrs. Bletchley had mentioned. It seemed to be staring directly at her.  
Or... maybe at something near the window.  
Yes, that must be it.  
There was no reason for a stray cat to sit and watch her.

Just as she finished straightening the cushions, she heard a car pull into the driveway.

## Unspoken Fears

She hadn't expected Vernon to be back yet.

"Did you manage to buy anything?" she asked, probing.  
"Nope. The prices were outrageous," he replied.

He looked calm but there was something in his demeanor that made Petunia nervous.  
She knew he was holding something back.  
And after the day she'd had, she sincerely hoped he would continue to do so.

She just wanted a normal Sunday — was that really too much to ask?

Instead, she started talking about her conversation with Mrs. Bletchley and showed him a few of the posts she had curated of Dudley.  
This seemed to settle him, and they had a very normal evening — something they were both quietly grateful for.

After dinner, once Dudley had gone to sleep, Vernon settled in the living room to catch the late news, while Petunia cleaned the kitchen to keep it spotless.  
The sound of the news drifted in from the living room. She could hear every word from where she stood.

> "...And finally, in lighter news, several residents across the country have reported unusual sightings of owls flying in broad daylight — with some even seen perching on traffic lights and rooftops in city centres.  
> Experts say the birds may be disoriented due to recent weather fluctuations or changes in migratory patterns. Wildlife organisations have urged the public not to be alarmed, and to avoid approaching the animals.  
> Still, with over one hundred and fifty sightings reported in the past 24 hours, locals are wondering whether the owls are trying to tell us something. A bit of magic in the air, perhaps?”

The mention of owls left Petunia unsettled.  
First cloaked men... Now owls...  
This day was already turning out to be more than she could handle.

No. It couldn't be _them._  
It must just be some abnormal weather phenomenon. A strange coincidence.  
After a good night's sleep, everything would be back to normal.

She put the kettle on and played some light music on her phone to drown out the news.  
Once the tea was ready, she poured it into a cup, turned off the music, and — with a deep breath — stepped into the living room.

Vernon was sitting frozen in his armchair.  
He had just heard the next segment — about flashes of coloured lights seen across the skies of Britain. Something Petunia had, luckily, missed.  
Vernon was in turmoil.  
Owls in broad daylight... Strange people in cloaks... And now fireworks raining from the sky...  
And earlier that day — a mention about the Potters...  
It was no use. He had to say something. He just had to keep it casual.

Petunia noticed how his frozen expression broke when he saw her. How he seemed to be wrestling with something unsaid.  
And how he finally composed himself again as she sat down beside him.

She didn't interrupt.  
She didn't question.  
She just hoped he wouldn't bring it up.  
She just wanted the day to end — and all the weirdness with it.

After a moment of silence, Vernon spoke.  
_"Petunia darling... have you heard from your sister lately?"_

There it was.  
The topic she had been dreading all day.  
He should have known better than to ask.

_"No,"_ she snapped.

Vernon's confidence faltered. His next words came in a nervous mumble.  
_"It's just... weird things have been happening today. The news reports, the people in cloaks... I thought maybe it had something to do with her people."_

As if she hadn't already wondered the same thing.  
The cloaks... The owls... The memories...  
She didn't respond.  
She didn't move.  
It was the least she could do — knowing that Vernon had kept all this to himself until now.

She simply drank her tea.

Vernon watched her silently. He could see his words had struck something. He decided not to mention the name he had heard.  
_Potter._  
But he still had to know.  
Trying again, trying to sound casual, he asked, _"They have a son, don't they? Around Dudley's age? Do you remember his name?"_

Petunia was beside herself now.  
He just had to push it further.  
Why all these questions?  
Why did it matter to him now?

Petunia didn't flinch.  
_"Harry,"_ she replied.

She stayed perfectly still, hoping — truly hoping — that would be the end of it.  
That he wouldn't press further.  
That he wouldn't share whatever else he was still holding back.  
That he would just... let it go.

Fortunately for her, Vernon didn't say another word on the topic.  
As he went upstairs to bed, Petunia went to her desk to put her tablet down — charging it for the night.  
She glanced at the locked box and firmly placed it into the drawer, out of sight.  
Tomorrow, everything would be back to normal.

She joined Vernon in bed. Emotionally and mentally drained by the conversation they had just had, she fell asleep quite quickly.

Vernon, however, couldn't sleep. He kept turning it over in his mind.  
Were the Potters involved in all this?  
What would happen if people found out they were related?

The Potters knew he wanted nothing to do with their kind.  
They wouldn't dare involve him. Surely not.

Maybe the Dursleys wouldn't get dragged into anything after all.  
He couldn't keep upsetting Petunia like this.  
Hopefully it would all go away — as quickly as it came.  
Tomorrow, this might just feel like a bad dream.  
With that comforting thought, he finally drifted to sleep as well.
